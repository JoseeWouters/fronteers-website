# Definition of done

Before committing to the repo, make sure you've checked the following:

- Responsive: make sure pages and components work on all device formats.

- Accessible: We want to be WCAG 2.1 AAA compliant. Don't forget: do images have an alt-attribute? Is everything accessible using only a keyboard? Is the contrast high enough?

- Progressive enhancement: all main content should be accessible with JavaScript turned off.

- Document the things you do: Everything should be well documented and easy to get into for other people. Add components to the [Kitchensink](https://fronteers.netlify.app/nl/kitchensink/) with various states, so editors know how to use them.
