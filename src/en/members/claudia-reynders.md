Claudia is a versatile professional who has already come a long way in the tech industry.

She took her first steps as a PHP web developer, but it soon became clear that Claudia was more into frontend and design. After working as a front-end developer for a number of years, she was able to start in a new position as a technical product manager, where she mainly worked with local startups. This was the first job in which Claudia also had to lead small teams.

Given that her own health limitations have already caused a number of obstacles, Claudia delved further into UX design. For example, she has also given guest lectures on accessible and inclusive design several times since then.

In 2017, Claudia started building a new community, which she continued to expand outside of her working hours. The aim of this community was to bring female developers from all over Belgium into contact with each other and to support them. This was done through all kinds of activities (meetups, workshops and interactive sessions), a monthly newsletter and interviews in which a local role model was always put in the spotlight. Individual advice sessions were also offered, where a member could ask for advice regarding their CV and how to tackle interviews.

Claudia's previous experiences and knowledge came in handy for this initiative, as all websites related to the community were designed, built and maintained by her. After 6 years and due to the ever-increasing number of challenges, it was finally decided to discontinue the initiative.

In the more recent years, Claudia has been active as a freelancer, combining the knowledge and experience she has gained in various tech-related roles over the years. Until recently, she worked as a career coach, guiding students from a coding bootcamp to the job market. Afterwards, she supported the same bootcamp for a while as a community manager, focusing on developing a mentor program for women in tech and an alumni community.

Claudia prefers to commit herself to goals that have a positive impact, such as the aforementioned mentor program, etc.
But don't hesitate to contact her if you have any questions or are looking for a sparring partner.
