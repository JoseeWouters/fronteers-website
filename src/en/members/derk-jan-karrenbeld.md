Whilst majoring in Computer Science, Derk-Jan worked in Silicon Valley and gained valuable experience at [incubators][wiki-incubator], [accelerators][wiki-accelerator], and various startups.

Nowadays he focuses on building complex custom software [together with his team in Rotterdam][delftsolutions], [complains and advocates for accessible software][talk-practically-accessible], and [volunteers at Exercism][profile-exercism] &mdash; a platform for developers who want to achieve fluency in a different programming language than the one(s) they already know.
