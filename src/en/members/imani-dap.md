I have been building professional websites, web applications and creative software since 2017. The fronteers Slack has taught me a lot during my studies and which is why I am happy member even though I am not strictly a front-ender. For the past year I have been able to enjoy freelancing full-time. From Jan 16th 2025 I will continue to do it part-time for a set of permanent partners in addition to a job as a software developer at Bitfactory.
