## About Humgy
Humgy coworking is a home base for entrepreneurs and teams. It's a place to expand your network without those cringy networking events, work productively and feel at home surrounded by like-minded entrepreneurs in an open space office or private offices.


## Talk 1: Leveraging the free tier of Cloudflare to make your website load faster.
In this talk Edward will give you some tips on how to make optimal use of Cloudflare’s free tier. He will show you some practical examples and give you the pros, cons and possible pitfalls that you can encounter.

## About Edward
Edward Vereertbrugghen is a full-stack developer and founder at OKGREAT, where he strives to create efficient and fast-loading websites. Outside of work, he has a passion for traveling and enjoying good food. He is a permanent resident at Humgy, where he brings his dog nala every day to the office.

## Talk 2: If View Transitions and Scroll-Driven Animations had a baby …
With View Transitions, you can create immersive native-like experiences that have smooth and seamless transitions between pages in your SPA. With Scroll-Transitions you can drive animations by the act of scrolling. What if you combined both? How does it work? And what about MPA? Could that ever work?

## About Bramus
Bramus Van Damme is a web developer from Belgium. From the moment he discovered view-source at the age of 14 (way back in 1997), he fell in love with the web and has been tinkering with it ever since.
As a Chrome Developer Relations Engineer at Google, he spreads the word on CSS, UI, and DevTools.
