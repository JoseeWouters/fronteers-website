## Talk 1: Talk #1: Optimizing the itsme® icon setup: using SVGO and SVG sprites by Milan Bauwens
Together with Fronteers host, Thomas Verleye, we optimized the itsme® icon setup. In order to enhance performance, we decided to replace SVGR with more performant technologies such as SVGO and SVG sprites. In this presentation, we’ll discuss the positive impacts and side effects of this migration.

### About Milan
Milan Bauwens is a Junior Frontend developer @Craftzing. He describes himself as a rookie in the Frontend world, but don’t underestimate his enthusiasm by anything digital. He loves experimenting with new tools and technologies that he hears about in office.

## Talk 2: A Safari Through Code: Exploring Panda CSS by Sybren Willemot
Join us for a safari where we delve into Panda CSS, a library from the Chakra UI-verse. This interactive session features a special co-host experimenting with Panda's tools to craft an engaging UI, with the audience's participation in choosing the project. We'll explore basic to advanced aspects of Panda CSS for efficient UI construction.

Our goal is to make this a fun, informative experience, encouraging attendees to experiment with these Panda CSS in various frameworks, including Astro, Vue, React, or Solid.

### About Sybren
Sybren is a front-end developer for a few years and works at Euricom in Belgium. He is part of the awesome Chakra-verse core team, focussing on the Vue side in for example Ark UI and Chakra UI Vue. You can also find him organizing meetups for BEL Vue and public speaking. In his spare time, he likes to travel with his family, visit amazing places, and meet great people.
