## Talk: by Elian Van Cutsem
We'll start by discovering the basics of Astro, why and where it's useful, and how to build a simple web application with it. We'll discover how to use Astro's hybrid rendering mode to add API routes and dynamic server-side rendering to the application. Then we'll dive into Astro DB, a simple, yet powerful ORM used to communicate between the database and your Astro application.

## Fishbowl Panel: Ethical Responsibility as a Software Developer, facilitated by Emma Dendooven
In today's world, it is more important than ever for software developers to consider their ethical responsibilities. However, this topic is not discussed often enough among developers.

We will start with a short introduction that sets the stage for a lively group debate. During the talk, we will delve deeply into the impact that our work has on society, the environment, and our fellow humans, and discuss where our responsibilities lie in the process. But it won't be a one-way conversation - we want to hear from you! Whether you are a seasoned pro or just starting out, your perspective is valuable.

This is your chance to share your thoughts, ideas, and questions with like-minded individuals. Emma believes that open and honest discussions are key to driving real change in our industry, and is excited to hear what you have to say.
