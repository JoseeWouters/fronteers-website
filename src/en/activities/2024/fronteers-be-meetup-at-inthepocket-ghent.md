## Talk 1: The browser is the framework?
Modern browsers have gotten really capable as platforms for vanilla web development. How much mileage can we get out of skipping all tooling and using the browser itself as a web framework? What are the alternatives to common framework features like routing, templating, components and reactive state? Let's take a walk down web standards lane and discover what is there, and what is still missing.

## Talk 2: If View Transitions and Scroll-Driven Animations had a baby …
With View Transitions, you can create immersive native-like experiences that have smooth and seamless transitions between pages in your SPA. With Scroll-Transitions you can drive animations by the act of scrolling. What if you combined both? How does it work? And what about MPA? Could that ever work?
