I was really nervous about starting my career switch from marketer to front-end developer. Starting a career switch is one thing, but actually working as a front-end developer is a whole different ball game. In this blog, I share my own insights and give tips on deciding to make the switch, the reskilling process itself, and how to land your first job as a front-end developer.



### Reskilling to Front-End Development: Where Do You Start?

The first step is to figure out whether front-end development truly suits you. My biggest tip: talk to front-end developers. Your perception of the role might differ from what it’s actually like.

How do you find these people? Join the Fronteers Slack group and ask if someone is willing to share their experiences. LinkedIn is also a great resource. I messaged a few front-end developers for an online coffee chat to ask them about their work. Not a single person said no, and it was also a great way to build my network. Questions like, “What does a typical workday look like?”, “What do you love about your job?”, and “What do you find challenging?” will give you a good idea of what the role entails and whether it’s a good fit for you.

### Choose a Reskilling Route That Suits You

Yes! You’re one step closer: you now know that front-end development is a good match. But what’s next?

There are many ways to reskill. You can focus on self-study, join a traineeship at a company, do a short training program of a few weeks, or a longer program lasting several months (either full-time or part-time). In short, there are plenty of options. Choose the one that fits your life best. If you can’t afford to study full-time for a few months (due to financial or time constraints), a part-time program might be a better choice. If you find a great company willing to train you on the job, even better!

I personally chose a full-time study program that lasted about six months. This wasn’t my first choice. It had been at least 10 years since I was a student, and I preferred to learn while working. So, I initially looked for a traineeship.

However, I encountered two challenges. While there were companies willing to take me on, when I asked about their training plans, the support they offered, and their reasons for wanting to train people, the answers weren’t always very concrete. The labor market is tight, and if a traineeship is only meant to cheaply bring in new people, that didn’t feel promising to me.

The companies that genuinely enjoyed training people and took it seriously, unfortunately, turned me down. Their feedback was that they were looking for candidates with more experience. That was tough to hear, but I stayed determined and thought: I’ll figure it out myself.

I ended up enrolling in a full-time reskilling program at Novi Hogeschool, even though the idea of studying full-time for seven months was daunting. In hindsight, I’m so glad I did it. Seven months felt long at first but flew by quickly. It was also great to have the time to fully develop my skills.

Nowadays, there are far more companies offering solid traineeships. For me, studying on my own gave me the comfort of growing without the added pressure of being in a company environment. Just ask the right questions during your search, and you’ll soon discover if it’s a mutual match or if you’d prefer an independent study route.


### How to Land Your First Job as a Front-End Developer

By now, you’ve poured your blood, sweat, and tears into your reskilling journey. Trust me, it’s tough. You really have to want it, and even then, it’s hard work. But it’s absolutely worth it!

Now, you’re ready for the next step: landing a job! During my studies, I worried a lot about this. I couldn’t imagine a company hiring someone with as little front-end experience as I had.

Surprisingly, it turned out to be much easier than I thought—well, sort of. I posted a message on LinkedIn saying I was looking for an exciting role as a front-end developer, explaining why I had reskilled and what kind of company I was hoping to work for. I received tons of responses within no time. In the end, I had eight job offers!

It was overwhelming—I hadn’t expected it at all. So, here are two tips:

1. A LinkedIn post can be incredibly effective.
2. Be selective about where you apply.

Don’t apply everywhere, like I did. It only makes it harder to choose. I also felt a lot of pressure from companies to make a quick decision. Looking back, I wish I had taken more time. Companies want you, so if you need more time, just say so and take it.

### Conclusion: Just Do It

After all the tips, advice, and experiences, here’s my final piece of advice: if it feels right, just go for it. The tech industry offers so many amazing opportunities. There are plenty of exciting jobs, lots of room for growth, and you’ll be a valuable addition as a career switcher.

Your previous work experience brings a unique perspective that others might not have.

Good luck and enjoy your new career!
