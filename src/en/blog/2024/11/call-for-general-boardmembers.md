With the General membership meeting already in sight, the current board wants to put out a call for members who would like to run for a general board position within Fronteers to do so in a timely manner.

As a general board member you help decide on the future of the association, but our board members also take a hands-on attitude when it comes to realizing ideas.

In terms of time commitment, this varies greatly per board member. Of course, it's up to you whether you want to spend a little more time. But there are monthly board meetings that you are expected to attend.

You can apply up to and including the day of the ALV. During the ALV, the current board will make a final call for people who wish to apply.
People who send in nominations after that will have to wait until the next ALV which, under normal circumstances, will take place a year from now.

If you would like more information about the ALV or the board, Claudia, Wim, Schepp and Jewwy are happy to help you via Slack or through mailing [bestuur@fronteers.nl](mailto:bestuur@fronteers.nl)!
