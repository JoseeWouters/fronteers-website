## Design

The design was made by [Ready For Take-Off](https://rfto.nl/). They provided us with a visual identity for our conference from 2015 to 2018, and in 2018, they helped us develop a new identity for the organisation.

## Fonts

We use Roboto and Fabrik on this website. Fabrik is a font by [TIGHTYPEâ„¢](https://tightype.com/). Fabrik is no longer available on their website, but we purchased it via email upon request.

## Hosting

The website is hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), who sponsor us with an [Open Source Unlimited](https://www.netlify.com/legal/open-source-policy/) package.

## Statistics

We are serious about the privacy of our visitors. Therefore, the only way we analyze visitor numbers is through the GDPR-friendly service of [Plausible.io](https://plausible.io/). Our [visitor statistics](https://plausible.io/fronteers.nl) can be viewed by everyone.
