On Friday evening, November 29, we will host the annual general membership meeting (ALV)!  This will take place online and you must register in advance to participate.

During the ALV we as a board, volunteers and members will go through the (financial) state of Fronteers together, and evaluate how the community is doing. Until the beginning of the meeting, any member can propose an agenda item or an item to be voted on. The preliminary agenda is below.

Already on the schedule is the going over of the community's annual documents for 2023, the finances for 2024 and the new budget for 2025. These documents will be sent to all registered attendees a few days before the ALV. If you cannot attend but would like to see this information: please let us know! Minutes of the evening are always shared online as soon as possible after the meeting.
