<h2>Getting to grips with Git by Pauline Vos</h2>
<p>If you're fighting with Git on a regular basis, you might not be using it optimally. This workshop will lay out how to make your life easier only by changing your daily Git usage through atomic commits and other best practices. Next time you're pulling your hair out from rebase hell, remember this workshop.</p>
<p>Many Git users tend to use Git as a save point, like in a video game; chronologically making checkpoint commits as they go. This spreads out changes to the same areas in the code over several commits, necessitates merging and resolving conflicts, and generally just makes an incomprehensible jumble of your history. During this day you'll learn when, why, and how to use atomic commits while only minimally affecting your workflow.</p>
