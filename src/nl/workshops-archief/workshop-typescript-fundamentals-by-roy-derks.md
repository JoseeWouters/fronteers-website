     <h2>TypeScript Fundamentals by Roy Derks</h2>
     <p>If you're developing applications with JavaScript you've probably already heard about TypeScript. TypeScript is a strongly-typed superset of JavaScript, that has incorporated all the modern JavaScript features and added a type-system on top of it. In this workshop, I'll teach you the fundamentals of TypeScript (v3+), by coding together (a lot).</p>
     <h4>What you'll learn:</h4>
     <ul>
      <li>Why TypeScript? Or type-systems?</li>
      <li>Project setup and configuration</li>
      <li>Primitives, interfaces, classes, generics</li>
      <li>Inference</li>
      <li>Custom types</li>
      <li>Applying TypeScript to existing projects</li>
     </ul>
     <h4>Requirements:</h4>
     <ul>
      <li>Experience with ES2015+</li>
      <li>A computer with node and npm installed</li>
      <li>IDE with TypeScript support</li>
     </ul>
